# Code for Experiment in Publication “A New Method for Multinomial Inference using Dempster-Shafer Theory”

All code used to perform the experiments in the cited publication.  For questions, issues, or clarifications please reach out to Murph: <murph@lanl.gov>.

This repository is organized according to the different directories needed to perform the experiment in the paper.  These directories are:


*paper_graphics: code to create the figures in the paper;
*runtime_experiments: code to recreate the computational runtime experiments in the paper.


## Software Required
Running this software requires access to the `R` programming language.  We found that the [dempsterpolytope](https://github.com/pierrejacob/dempsterpolytope) package worked better on a Windows computer.
